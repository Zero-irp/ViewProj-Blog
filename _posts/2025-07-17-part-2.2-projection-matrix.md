### **What is the Projection Matrix?**

While the View Matrix transforms world coordinates into the camera's local space, the Projection Matrix transforms that 3D camera space into a clipped 2D space that’s ready for 
display on a screen.  
This is the step where perspective is introduced where far objects look smaller, and near objects look larger.
>view space -> clip space

The projection matrix defines how the 3D scene (Game) is projected onto a 2D surface (Your screen).  
It Determines:  
- What part of the world is visible through the camera (field of view).
- How deep the camera can see (near/far clipping planes).
- How the perspective distortion should look (objects farther away appear smaller etc...)
- Defines the 3D view Frustum  

There are two main types of projection matrices  
- **Perspective Projection**
- **Orthographic Projection**

Here we will only be looking at the Perspective Projection Matrix.

### **What the Projection Matrix Does:**

The projection matrix warps the view space into what's known as Normalized Device Coordinates (NDC).  
In NDC:  
- The x, y, and z coordinates are squeezed into a cube from -1 to 1.
- Everything inside this cube is visible.
- Everything outside is clipped (not rendered).

The *Projection Matrix* represnets how the camera sees. It gives the world its sense of depth and perspective, and its parameters -
FOV, aspect ratio, near and far planes define the visible 3D frustum.

### Layout of the Perspective Projection Matrix

Here is the standard layout of a row-major perspective projection matrix (DirectX):

| xScale |     0    |      0         |         0 |
|    0   |  yScale  |     0          |        0 |
|    0   |    0     | zfar/(zfar - znear)   |        1 |
|    0   |    0   | -znear*zfar/(zfar - znear) |         0 |

Lets breakdown all the parameters:  
- **zNear:** Near clip plane
- **zFar:** Far clip plane
- **xScale:** 1 / tan(Fov_X/2)
- **yScale:** 1 / tan(Fov_Y/2) or 1 / AspectRatio * tan(Fov_X/2) where Fov_Y = (Aspect Ratio * Fov_X)  

*We’ll later see how this matrix fits into the full pipeline and how the 3D position finally lands on your screen.*
