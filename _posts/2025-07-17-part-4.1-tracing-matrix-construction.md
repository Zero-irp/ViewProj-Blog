### Tracing Functions Writing to The View-Projection Matrix

Lets start by observing which function writes to the View-Projection Matrix by clicking on the "Find out what writes this address" on the first element
of the View-Projection Matrix.  

![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/find-what-writes-vpmatrix.png)

We have found 2 different functions that seem to write to this address.
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/found-what-writes-vpmatrix.png)

The first instruction seems to reference an address "VCRUNTIME140.memset+134:" and the second one reference's "GhostOfTsushima.exe+9AA0AF:".  
The second instruction intregiues me more so lets look at that one.  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/9aa082-ins-asm-ce.png) 

Here [rdi+0x5C0] is our static memory address of the view projection matrix and is getting written into by "xmm0".

>In x64 systems, xmm registers are part of the SSE (Streaming SIMD Extensions) register set. Each xmm register is 
128 bits wide, which makes them ideal for handling vectors, matrices, and other packed floating-point operations. Modern Games use 
SIMD ("Single instruction Multiple Data") instructions using these registers to optimize performance when doing things like 
matrix math and transformations.

Lets now see where "xmm0" gets its 4, 32bit float values from. In the instruction just above we see "xmm0" gets its value from  
"movups xmm0,[rax+00000240]" which means [rax+00000240] would be where it seems to copy the values from.

**lets see this entire function in ida before moving further**  

lets "select current function" in cheat engine to get the function start address which is "GhostOfTsushima.exe+9AA040".  
Lets put this in ida and see its pseudo-code.
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/ida-view-9aa082.png)

>Don’t forget to rebase IDA to "0" before searching for the address in the function subview!  
Alternatively, you can calculate the offset between the Cheat Engine base and the IDA base manually using a calculator.

While stepping through the function, I didn’t encounter many SIMD instructions like "mm_mul", "mm_add_ps", or "mm_shuffle_ps".
Instead, it appears that the function is primarily copying matrices from dynamic memory into this static location,  possibly from a 
camera struct or a similar source.  

Let's now see what function writes to the dynamic address that its copying from ([rax+0x240]).
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/matrix-copy-ins-write.png)

We can see one instruction reference "GhostOfTsushima.exe+7FC11B:". Let's select the current function and plug it into ida to see its pseudo code.  

```cpp
char __fastcall sub_7FBF10(__int64 a1, __m128 *a2, __m128 *a3)
{

> This is just a snippet of the start of the function.

In Windows x64, function parameters are passed using the Microsoft x64 calling convention, where the first four arguments are 
passed via registers in the following order:

- RCX → first argument (a1)
- RDX → second argument (a2)
- R8 → third argument (a3)
- R9 → fourth argument (a4)

Any additional arguments beyond the fourth are passed on the stack. The return value is typically stored in RAX.  
With this in mind, we can infer that a1, a2, and a3 in the function correspond to the values of RCX, RDX, and R8 
respectively at the time of the call.  
We'll set a breakpoint at the start of the function in Cheat Engine to further analyze which will  allow us to inspect the 
contents of these registers when the function is called.  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/ce-7fbf10-breakpoint.png)

For now, the only argument of interest is a1, which corresponds to RCX. In this particular call, RCX = 0x2D72494D200.  
I consider it “interesting” because of the following code snippet:  
```cpp
  *(__m128 *)(a1 + 0x550) = *a2;
  *(__m128 *)(a1 + 0x430) = *a3;
  *(__m128 *)(a1 + 0x440) = a3[1];
  *(__m128 *)(a1 + 0x450) = a3[2];
  *(__m128 *)(a1 + 0x460) = a3[3];
```

looking through the function we notice that it loads a single 4x4 matrix and a Vector4 near the start.  
Let’s inspect the values at those offsets in memory.  
At [a1 + 0x430], we find what appears to be a ViewProjection matrix without the translation component:  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/reclass-view-proj-no-trans.png)  

And at [a1 + 0x550], we find a Vector4 that corresponds to the camera position:   
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/reclass-cam-pos.png)

Since this function receives the view-projection matrix (without translation) as input, we can reasonably infer that the actual 
multiplication of the View and Projection matrices occurs earlier in the call stack. That means we’ll need to trace back 
further to locate the point where the View and Projection matrices are composed into this intermediate result.  
This function appears to take an intermediate view-projection matrix. One without translation and adds the translational components 
to produce the final view-projection matrix used in rendering.  
>We’ll break down this function in detail later, but for now, our goal is to trace the data flow further upstream to locate where 
this matrix begins its construction.

Let's breakpoint at the start of the function and use the "stack trace" feature in cheat engine.  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/ce-stack-trace-realfunc.png)  

The first function is the function we are inside of.  
The instruction at GhostOfTsushima.exe+7FD233 is part of the function that called our current function at 7FBF10 

We'll grab the start address of the caller and plug it inside of IDA for further analysis.

```

This function takes a single argument, probably a pointer to the camera structure.  
Notably, it accesses two 4x4 matrices  

[a1+0x200]:  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/a1+200-matrix.png)  
This is just the Projection Matrix.

[a1+0x140]:  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.1/a1+140-matrix.png)  
This is just the Camera World Matrix.  

Throughout the function, we see extensive use of _mm_mul_ps, _mm_add_ps, and _mm_shuffle_ps which is a indicator for SIMD matrix multiplication. 
The v16 array, which is made up of __m128 values, is gradually filled with the result of these operations, effectively forming a 4x4 matrix.  

*Now that we have confirmed that this is probably the matrix construction function of the View-Projection matrix we can now start reversing 
its many SIMD instructions to see what exactly it does with the camera world matrix and projection matrix.*
