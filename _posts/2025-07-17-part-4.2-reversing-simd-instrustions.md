### ⚠️ Note for readers:
This post is meant for intermediate to advanced readers who want to understand how low-level SIMD instructions are 
used in real-world graphics code (like game engines).  
That said, I’ve done my best to break things down step-by-step, even if you're still learning, I hope parts of it are still approachable.

### Reversing SIMD instructions

Let's start by disecting the instructions in sub_7FBF10 which we will rename to "ProjXViewMul" and rename the camera world matrix and 
projection matrix accessed in this function as CamWorldMat and ProjMat respectivly and a1 as camStruct.

Let's start with the first explanation of the SIMD instruction.  
The bitmask used in the instruction:  
```cpp
CamWorldMat_2 = _mm_and_ps((__m128)xmmword_1138D50, *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x160));
```
relies on a clever use of NaN values as a bitmask.  
xmmword_1138D50 is a static memory address that holds four 32-bit floats:  
(Nan, Nan, Nan, 0.f)  

Here **specfically** 'Nan' refer to a 32 bit value where all bits are filped to 1.  
![ESP-Image1](/ViewProj-Blog/assets/images/part-4.2/ieee-float-binary.png)  
>NaN doesn’t literally mean “all bits 1” (0xFFFFFFFF), that's one specific payload of NaN

As shown above:  

- Exponent bits are all 1s
- Mantissa bits are non-zero
- Resulting value is NaN, but its binary pattern is '11111111111111111111111111111111'

So, when _mm_and_ps() uses (Nan, Nan, Nan, 0.f):  

- NaN & X,Y,Z = X,Y,Z (because all bits are 1 → preserves input)
- 0.0f & W = 0 (because all bits are 0 → clears input)

Doing this, the bitwise AND preserve x/y/z while zeroing out w.  

#### *Next SIMD instruction.*
```cpp
CamWorldMat_3_camPos = _mm_shuffle_ps(
                           *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170),
                           _mm_shuffle_ps((__m128)xmmword_10F0E70, *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170), 0xA0),
                           0x24);
```

Let's begin with the explanation of the _mm_shuffle_ps function:  
```cpp
__m128 _mm_shuffle_ps(__m128 a, __m128 b, const int imm8);
```

This intrinsic takes in two __m128 vectors (a and b) and an 8-bit immediate value (imm8) that determines how elements 
from these vectors are selected and rearranged into the output.  
Let’s denote the result as c. The output vector c is constructed as follows:  

- c[0] → element from 'a' selected by the lowest two bits of imm8
- c[1] → element from 'a' selected by bits 2–3 of imm8
- c[2] → element from 'b' selected by bits 4–5 of imm8
- c[3] → element from 'b' selected by bits 6–7 of imm8

In short, the immediate value controls which elements from a and b are placed into each position of the result.  

Now let’s walk through and understand a nested _mm_shuffle_ps instruction. Lets start with:  
```cpp
_mm_shuffle_ps((__m128)xmmword_10F0E70, *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170), 0xA0)
```
xmmword_10F0E70 is a static memory address that holds four 32-bit floats:  
(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f)  
*(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170) is the camera position:  
(-112913.16f, -613576.88f, 2234.39f, 1.0f)  
The immediate value 0xA0 (in binary 10100000) tells us how to shuffle the inputs.   
so output 'c' is:  
- c[0] -> a[00] , 1.0f
- c[1] -> a[00] , 1.0f
- c[2] -> b[10] , 2234.39f
- c[3] -> b[10] , 2234.39f

In the other shuffle intrisic is: 
```cpp
_mm_shuffle_ps(*(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170), 'c', 0x24)
```
0x24 in hex is: 00100100  
The final output will be:  

- CamWorldMat_3[0] -> (camStruct + 0x170)[00] , -112913.16f
- CamWorldMat_3[1] -> (camStruct + 0x170)[01] , -613576.88f
- CamWorldMat_3[2] -> c[10] , 2234.39f
- CamWorldMat_3[3] -> c[00] , 1.0f

This just seems to give the same vec4. Effectively being CamWorldMat_3 = *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x170)  

>I honestly don’t know why the developers chose to perform these shuffle operations when the final result is already 
present in memory at camStruct + 0x170. It could be due to a variety of reasons, maybe legacy code, a byproduct of 
compiler optimizations, or perhaps a more general-purpose function that handles multiple cases in production.
As reverse engineers, we often encounter code that appears redundant or overly complex until seen in its full context. 
While it’s tempting to assume we fully understand the intention behind every instruction, sometimes the best approach 
is to acknowledge what we don’t know and document the observable behavior and move forward.  

### Negating a Vector with SIMD

```cpp
CamWorldMat_1_negated = _mm_sub_ps((__m128)0LL, _mm_and_ps((__m128)xmmword_1138D50, *(__m128 *)(camStruct + 0x150)));
```
The constant xmmword_1138D50 once again holds the values (NaN, NaN, NaN, 0.0f), and is used here as a bitmask just like before.

```cpp
_mm_sub_ps((__m128)0LL, result_of_above)
```

- (__m128)0LL creates a 128-bit SIMD vector containing all zeros: (0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f)
- This Effectively does: 
	- (0 - x, 0 - y, 0 - z, 0 - 0) → (-x, -y, -z, 0)

This SIMD instruction is simply a way to negate a 3D vector while keeping the W component cleared. In the context of a 4x4 camera world matrix 
this is used to possibly convert *handedness*.

### mm_unpack

```cpp
mergedHigh = _mm_unpackhi_ps(CamWorldMat_1_negated, CamWorldMat_2);
mergedLow = _mm_unpacklo_ps(CamWorldMat_1_negated, CamWorldMat_2);
```

The _mm_unpacklo_ps and _mm_unpackhi_ps instructions are used to merge parts of two __m128 vectors  

**_mm_unpacklo_ps**  
This unpacks (merges) the lower 64 bits (the first two floats) of both vectors. So it combines the x and y 
components of each vector in an alternating pattern.  
```cpp
mergedLow = (CamWorldMat_1_negated.x, CamWorldMat_2.x, CamWorldMat_1_negated.y, CamWorldMat_2.y)
```

**_mm_unpackhi_ps**  
Similarly merges the higher 64 bits (the last two floats) of both vectors, so it combines the z and w components in the same alternating fashion. 
```cpp
mergedHigh = (CamWorldMat_1_negated.z, CamWorldMat_2.z, CamWorldMat_1_negated.w, CamWorldMat_2.w)
```


### Shuffling and Masking Intermediate Vectors

```cpp
v11 = _mm_and_ps(_mm_shuffle_ps(mergedHigh, CamWorldMat_0, 0x24), (__m128)NaNNaNNaN0f_Mask);
v12 = _mm_and_ps(_mm_shuffle_ps(mergedLow,  CamWorldMat_0, 0x1E), (__m128)NaNNaNNaN0f_Mask);
v13 = _mm_and_ps(_mm_shuffle_ps(mergedLow,  CamWorldMat_0, 0x04), (__m128)NaNNaNNaN0f_Mask);
```

These instructions continue the SIMD-based matrix construction logic.  

- Shuffles components from mergedLow, mergedHigh, and CamWorldMat_0 using _mm_shuffle_ps
- Then masks the result using NaNNaNNaN0f_Mask to zero out the W component (renamed xmmword_1138D50)

Since we’ve already broken down how _mm_shuffle_ps and _mm_and_ps work earlier in this post, we won’t repeat that here.

### What’s Going on at a High Level?

This phase seems to lay out the basis vectors (right, up, forward) and possibly the camera position, in 
preparation for writing a full matrix, likely a transposed camera world matrix or a step in computing its inverse.

We'll look at how this fits into the final matrix soon.
