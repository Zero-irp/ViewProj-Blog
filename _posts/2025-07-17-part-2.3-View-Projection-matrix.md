### **What is the View-Projection Matrix?**

The View-Projection Matrix (or simply the *VP Matrix*) is simply the result of multiplying the View Matrix and the Projection Matrix together:
>ViewProjection = Projection * View  
Note: Matrix multiplication is not commutative:- A * B ≠ B * A  
The multiplication order depends on the graphics system, influenced by its row/column major layout and handedness.

This combined matrix allows you to transform a world-space position directly into clip space in one step. Instead of first 
applying the view matrix, then the projection matrix separately, both transformations are handled at once:

>clipSpacePos = ViewProjection * worldSpacePos

This is both mathematically valid and computationally efficient, which is why many engines precompute and cache the View-Projection matrix.  
In many game engines the memory this Matrix is stored in is usually in a static memory address due to high reuse for computation thus it makes
more sense to cache it in known spots.

Even though it’s just a product of two other matrices, the View-Projection matrix plays a central role in rendering.
It represents the full transformation from world-space to clip-space and is often the matrix most directly used when deciding what shows up on screen.  

*This is all we’ll cover about the View-Projection matrix for now. The goal isn’t to dive deep into 3D rendering, but to build a clear, 
working understanding of how it functions at a basic level.*
